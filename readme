You must install xlrd package

enter into your terminal
pip install xlrd

if you get an error, you probably don’t have pip
then, google how to install it

To run the file open Upload_main.py file
python3 Upload_main.py


If you have problem with database try to delete it by hand 

delete: __pycache__
delete: student.db
delete: student.db-journal

If you want to seed database with examples:

open file
press Upload button
choice examples.xls
press Save

P.S examples.xls contains just random letters(I don’t have patience for doing it properly)


We are using SQlite3 database, it comes with python

PLEASE if you find any bugs, let my know what you did, and what terminal(cmd windows) says.

If you have any questions text me on messenger.

You can find search example in file SearchExample.py, it works only with ID right know!!!!!!!

Right know tutor_list is literally python list in Upload_main.py file
